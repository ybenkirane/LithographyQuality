# LithographyQuality
Analyzing the quality of a nanofabricated lithography pattern. 


To compute the quality of the lithography pattern, you can use a combination of techniques like image registration and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Image registration will help you align the generated pattern with the original pattern, and SSIM will provide you with a quality score.
